You are a senior .NET engineer. Build a complete, working **Order Management** web service in
C# on **.NET 10** that satisfies the specification included at the END of this message, in full.

**Framework for this build:** scaffold the solution with the Trellis ASP template:

```
dotnet new install Trellis.AspTemplate@1.0.21-alpha
dotnet new trellis-asp -n OrderManagement
```

Implement the service on the Trellis framework, following the guidance and API references
bundled in the generated project's `.github/` folder. Replace the sample `Todo` domain with
the Order Management domain from the spec.

**Deliverable**

- A solution that **builds** with no errors.
- All **14 HTTP endpoints** exactly as listed in spec §7 (paths, verbs, success codes,
  `?api-version` requirement, `Location` headers on creates).
- The full domain behavior in spec §3–§6 (lifecycle state machine, stock reserve/release,
  line-item rules, order total).
- The error contract in spec §9 (validation → 400, not-found → 404, duplicate → 409,
  forbidden → 403) returned as structured error bodies.
- The authorization model in spec §5 (per-operation permissions, the cancel-ownership check,
  the `X-Test-Actor` header convention).
- An **automated test suite** that runs and passes (spec §10).
- SQLite persistence as described in spec §8.

**Rules**

- Build it to completion. Do not ask clarifying questions; make reasonable engineering
  decisions where the spec is silent.
- Use `TimeProvider` for time-dependent logic (no `DateTime.UtcNow` in domain code).
- Do not hard-code test-only shortcuts into production code paths.
- When you are done, the service must start and serve `GET /health` → 200.

# SPECIFICATION (the single input for this task)

# Order Management System — Specification

> This is a **framework-agnostic functional specification** for a simplified but realistic Order Management System. It defines **what** to build — the business rules, API contracts, error behavior, and tests — and intentionally leaves **all** implementation choices (architecture, libraries, frameworks, patterns, and code structure) to the implementer. Build it as a working .NET (C#) web API using whatever approach you judge best. The spec focuses on business requirements and observable outcomes, not on how they are realized.

> **Revision (2026-06-12):** semantic validation failures map to **HTTP 422** (Unprocessable Content, RFC 9110 §15.5.21), not 400. A malformed request — invalid JSON syntax or a missing `api-version` — still returns **400 Bad Request**. (The benchmark's evaluation accepts either 400 or 422 for validation, so this revision is score-neutral; see `METHODOLOGY.md`.)


## 1. Domain Overview

A company sells products to customers. Customers place orders, each order contains line items referencing products. Orders go through a lifecycle from draft to completion. Payments are processed externally. Inventory is tracked per product.

The system uses role-based access control. Sales representatives create customers and orders. Warehouse managers approve and ship orders. Administrators have full access.

## 2. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Customer** | A person or organization that places orders. Identified by a unique ID. Has a name, email, optional phone number, and shipping address. |
| **Product** | An item available for purchase. Has a name, SKU, unit price, and current stock quantity. |
| **Order** | A request by a customer to purchase one or more products. Has a unique ID, belongs to one customer, contains one or more line items, and has a status. Records which actor created it. |
| **Line Item** | A single entry in an order specifying a product, quantity, and unit price at time of order. |
| **Order Status** | The current state of an order: Draft, Submitted, Approved, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled. |
| **SKU** | Stock Keeping Unit — a unique alphanumeric identifier for a product, 3–20 characters, uppercase letters and digits only. |
| **Shipping Address** | A value consisting of street, city, state, postal code, and country. All fields required. |
| **Order Total** | The sum of (unit price × quantity) for all line items in the order. |
| **Inventory** | The current available stock quantity of a product. Cannot go below zero. |
| **Actor** | The authenticated user performing an operation. Has an identity, a set of permissions, and optional attributes. |
| **Permission** | A named capability granted to an actor (e.g., `orders:create`). Checked before operations execute. |

## 3. Aggregates

### 3.1 Customer Aggregate

**Identity:** CustomerId (unique identifier)

**Properties:**
- FirstName — required, 1–100 characters
- LastName — required, 1–100 characters
- Email — valid email address, unique across all customers
- PhoneNumber — optional, valid phone number
- ShippingAddress — street, city, state, postal code, country (all required)

**Rules:**
- A customer cannot be created without a valid name, email, and shipping address.
- PhoneNumber is optional.
- Email must be unique. Attempting to create a customer with a duplicate email produces a Conflict error.

### 3.2 Product Aggregate

**Identity:** ProductId (unique identifier)

**Properties:**
- ProductName — required, 1–200 characters
- SKU — required, 3–20 characters, uppercase alphanumeric only, unique across all products
- UnitPrice — must be greater than zero, USD currency
- StockQuantity — non-negative integer

**Rules:**
- A product cannot be created without a valid name, SKU, and unit price.
- SKU must be unique. Attempting to create a product with a duplicate SKU produces a Conflict error.
- Stock quantity cannot go below zero. Attempting to reduce stock below zero produces a Validation error.

**Operations:**
- `AddStock(quantity)` — increases stock quantity. Quantity must be positive.
- `ReserveStock(quantity)` — decreases stock quantity. Fails if insufficient stock.

### 3.3 Order Aggregate

**Identity:** OrderId (unique identifier)

**Properties:**
- CustomerId — reference to an existing customer
- CreatedByActorId — the identity of the user who created the order
- LineItems — collection of line items (at least one required)
- Status — current order status
- CreatedAt — UTC timestamp when order was created
- SubmittedAt — UTC timestamp when order was submitted (absent if not yet submitted)
- ShippedAt — UTC timestamp when order was shipped (absent if not yet shipped)

**Line Item Properties:**
- LineItemId (unique identifier)
- ProductId — reference to an existing product
- ProductName — snapshot of product name at time of ordering
- Quantity — positive integer, minimum 1, maximum 999
- UnitPrice — snapshot of product price at time of ordering

**Rules:**
- An order must have at least one line item.
- An order must reference a valid customer.
- Each line item must reference a valid product.
- The same product cannot appear in multiple line items within the same order. Combine quantities instead.
- Quantity per line item must be between 1 and 999.
- Unit price is captured at the time the line item is added and does not change if the product price changes later.

## 4. State Machine

Order status transitions follow these rules:

```
Draft → Submitted → Approved → Shipped → Delivered
                                  ↓
                              Cancelled

Draft → Cancelled
Submitted → Cancelled
Approved → Cancelled
```

**Transition: Draft → Submitted**
- Precondition: Order must have at least one line item.
- Precondition: All line items must have sufficient stock available.
- Side effect: Reserve stock for each line item (reduce product stock quantity).
- Side effect: Set SubmittedAt to current UTC time.
- Domain event: OrderSubmittedEvent(OrderId, CustomerId, OrderTotal, SubmittedAt)

**Transition: Submitted → Approved**
- Precondition: None beyond being in Submitted status.
- Domain event: OrderApprovedEvent(OrderId, ApprovedAt)

**Transition: Approved → Shipped**
- Precondition: None beyond being in Approved status.
- Side effect: Set ShippedAt to current UTC time.
- Domain event: OrderShippedEvent(OrderId, CustomerId, ShippedAt)

**Transition: Shipped → Delivered**
- Precondition: None beyond being in Shipped status.
- Domain event: OrderDeliveredEvent(OrderId, DeliveredAt)

**Transition: Draft/Submitted/Approved → Cancelled**
- Precondition: Order must NOT be in Shipped or Delivered status.
- Side effect: If order was Submitted or Approved, release reserved stock (restore product stock quantity for each line item).
- Domain event: OrderCancelledEvent(OrderId, CancelledFromStatus, CancelledAt)

**Invalid transitions produce a Validation error with a message explaining why the transition is not allowed.**

## 5. Authorization

### 5.1 Permissions

The system defines the following permissions:

| Permission | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `customers:create` | Create new customers |
| `products:create` | Create new products |
| `products:manage-stock` | Add stock to products |
| `orders:create` | Create draft orders and manage line items |
| `orders:submit` | Submit draft orders |
| `orders:approve` | Approve submitted orders |
| `orders:ship` | Ship approved orders |
| `orders:deliver` | Mark shipped orders as delivered |
| `orders:cancel` | Cancel orders (subject to ownership check) |
| `orders:read` | View orders |
| `orders:read-all` | View any customer's orders and overdue orders |

### 5.2 Roles

Roles are not enforced by the system — they exist in the identity provider. The spec defines them here so test fixtures can construct actors with the right permission sets.

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **SalesRep** | `customers:create`, `orders:create`, `orders:submit`, `orders:cancel`, `orders:read` |
| **WarehouseManager** | `products:create`, `products:manage-stock`, `orders:approve`, `orders:ship`, `orders:deliver`, `orders:read-all` |
| **Admin** | All permissions |

### 5.3 Permission Checks

Every command and query declares its required permissions. Missing permission → Forbidden error → HTTP 403.

### 5.4 Resource-Based Authorization (Cancel Order)

Cancel Order has an ownership check in addition to the `orders:cancel` permission:

- An actor with `orders:cancel` can cancel an order **only if** the actor created the order (actor's identity matches order's CreatedByActorId).
- An actor with **both** `orders:cancel` and `orders:read-all` (i.e., Admin) can cancel any order regardless of who created it.

### 5.5 Actor Provider

In the API layer, the current actor is determined from the request context:
- Actor identity from the `sub` (or `oid`) claim
- Actor permissions from `role` claims

For testing and evaluation, the API layer reads a custom `X-Test-Actor` header containing a JSON payload: `{"id": "actor-1", "permissions": ["orders:create", "orders:read"]}`. If the header is absent, use a default Admin actor so existing tests don't break.

## 6. Operations (Use Cases)

The operations below are the use cases the system must support. Each is either a write operation that mutates state (labelled *Command*) or a read operation (labelled *Query*); these labels describe the operation's effect, not a required code structure. How you organize them is up to you.

### 6.1 Create Customer (Command)

## 7. API Endpoints

All endpoints return JSON. Error responses follow RFC 9457 (Problem Details). API versioning uses query parameter `api-version` with date values (e.g., `?api-version=2026-11-12`).

| Method | Path | Operation | Permission | Success | Error Codes |
|--------|------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| POST | /api/customers | Create Customer | `customers:create` | 201 Created | 400, 422, 403, 409 |
| POST | /api/products | Create Product | `products:create` | 201 Created | 400, 422, 403, 409 |
| POST | /api/products/{id}/stock-additions | Add Stock | `products:manage-stock` | 200 OK | 400, 422, 403, 404 |
| POST | /api/orders | Create Draft Order | `orders:create` | 201 Created | 400, 422, 403, 404 |
| POST | /api/orders/{id}/line-items | Add Line Item | `orders:create` | 200 OK | 400, 422, 403, 404 |
| DELETE | /api/orders/{id}/line-items/{lineItemId} | Remove Line Item | `orders:create` | 200 OK | 400, 422, 403, 404 |
| POST | /api/orders/{id}/submission | Submit Order | `orders:submit` | 200 OK | 400, 422, 403, 404 |
| POST | /api/orders/{id}/approval | Approve Order | `orders:approve` | 200 OK | 400, 422, 403, 404 |
| POST | /api/orders/{id}/shipment | Ship Order | `orders:ship` | 200 OK | 400, 422, 403, 404 |
| POST | /api/orders/{id}/delivery | Deliver Order | `orders:deliver` | 200 OK | 400, 422, 403, 404 |
| POST | /api/orders/{id}/cancellation | Cancel Order | `orders:cancel` + ownership | 200 OK | 400, 422, 403, 404 |
| GET | /api/orders/{id} | Get Order | `orders:read` | 200 OK | 403, 404 |
| GET | /api/customers/{id}/orders | List Orders by Customer | `orders:read-all` | 200 OK | 403, 404 |
| GET | /api/orders/overdue | List Overdue Orders | `orders:read-all` | 200 OK | 403 |

- All requests must include `?api-version=2026-11-12` query parameter. Requests without a version return 400 Bad Request.
- All requests must include authentication context via the `X-Test-Actor` header (see Section 5.5). Requests without authentication context use the default Admin actor.
- POST /customers and POST /orders return 201 Created with a Location header pointing to the created resource.
- A `/health` endpoint must be available for health checks.

## 8. Persistence

- **Database:** SQLite (file-based, zero setup).
- **Connection string** in `appsettings.Development.json`: `Data Source=OrderManagement.db`.
- **Entities to persist:** Customer, Product, Order (with LineItems).
- **Unique constraints:** Customer.Email, Product.SKU.
- **Indexes:** Order by CustomerId. Order by Status + SubmittedAt (for overdue query performance).
- **OrderStatus** stored as string.
- **PhoneNumber** stored as nullable column.
- **Database creation:** Use `EnsureCreated()` on startup in development mode. Do NOT use EF Core migrations — `EnsureCreated` is simpler for development and avoids migration conflicts on repeated runs.

## 9. Error Behavior

| Situation | Expected Error | HTTP Status |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Invalid input (blank name, bad email format, etc.) | Validation error | 422 |
| Invalid state transition (e.g., Draft → Approved) | Validation error | 422 |
| Insufficient stock on submit | Validation error | 422 |
| Entity not found by ID | Not Found error | 404 |
| Duplicate email on customer creation | Conflict error | 409 |
| Duplicate SKU on product creation | Conflict error | 409 |
| Missing required permission | Forbidden error | 403 |
| Cancel order by non-owner (without admin) | Forbidden error | 403 |
| Malformed request (invalid JSON syntax) | Bad Request | 400 |
| Missing `api-version` query parameter | Bad Request | 400 |

**Status-code rationale.** Semantic validation failures — a well-formed request whose *values*
violate a business rule (blank name, bad email format, invalid state transition, insufficient
stock) — return **422 Unprocessable Content** (RFC 9110 §15.5.21). **400 Bad Request** is reserved
for requests the server cannot parse at all (malformed JSON, missing required `api-version`).


## 10. Testing Requirements

### 10.1 Domain Tests

Unit tests for each aggregate's business rules. No external dependencies.

- Customer: valid creation with/without phone, invalid email, blank name
- Product: valid creation, add stock, reserve stock, insufficient stock error
- Order: create with line items, add/remove line items, duplicate product rejection, last line item protection
- State machine: every valid transition, every invalid transition, stock reservation on submit, stock release on cancel
- Overdue specification: matches orders submitted 8+ days ago, excludes recent orders and approved orders

### 10.2 Application Tests

Handler tests with mocked repositories.

- Authorization: command succeeds with correct permission, fails with missing permission
- Resource authorization: cancel by owner succeeds, cancel by non-owner fails, cancel by admin succeeds
- Not found: handler returns Not Found error when entity doesn't exist

### 10.3 API Integration Tests

HTTP round-trip tests using a test web application factory with SQLite in-memory.

- Create customer → 201 with Location header
- Duplicate email → 409 with Problem Details
- Missing permission → 403
- Full order lifecycle: create customer, create product, add stock, create order, submit, approve, ship, deliver
- Cancel by non-owner → 403
- Cancel by owner → 200
- Overdue orders query → 200 with correct filtered list
- Missing api-version → 400
- Health check → 200
